    <h2 class="title">Welcome to Comic Sams!</h2>
    <div class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Comic Sams is a project designed to give Google Chrome browsers
        some variety and color. Other extensions and themes give
        a plain, single color or picture outline to your Google Chrome browsing experience. To combat this, the Comic
        Sams
        Google Chrome
        Extension was made.

    <h2 class="title">Features</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Comic Sans MT Changer&trade;</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">The Comic Sans MT Changer&trade; is a patent pending product designed to smooth the normal
        sharp fonts on webpages. We
        use a flexible and extendable code base to allow us to find all of the text on pages and automatically replace
        the font
        for you.
    </div>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Rainbow Text Generator&trade;</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">The Rainbow Text Generator&trade; adds some variation of color to any text on a web page.
        With this, even if you aren't
        using the Comic Sans MT Changer (not recommended), the colors will make the text easy on the eyes yet add
        vibrant,
        rapidly changing
        colors to the theme of your browser. For this, we use our patent pending RRCCG (Random Rapidly Changing Color
        Generator)
        to create an infinite, random possibility of colors so you never get bored.
    </div>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Image Replacer&trade;</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">The Image Replacer&trade; strives to create a comfortable, almost-PG environment for its
        users. There are many explicit
        and terrifying images on the internet, and while we couldn't only block those out, we still want our users to be
        safe.
        To do that,
        the Image Replacer&trade; replaces all images in your browser with a random gif with a search term of the user's
        choosing.
    </div>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Background Blaster&trade;</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">The Background Blaster&trade; allows users to incorporate a fun variety of color to their
        screen. Whatever their mood,
        the user will find a color (and then lose it very quickly) that fits it, with the background colors changing
        almost
        every 100 milliseconds.
    </div>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Special Spinner&trade;</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">The Special Spinner&trade; allows for static webpages to instantly become dynamic. Simply
        enabling the option will make any website feel "alive".
